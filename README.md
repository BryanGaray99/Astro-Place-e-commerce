# Astro Place e-commerce - Project of the course React.js with Vite.js and Tailwind CSS from Platzi

## Description
Here is the final project of the "React.js con Vite.js y Tailwind CSS" course from Platzi. 
My goal with the course was to put into practice web development skills and create an interactive, 
responsive and customized mock e-commerce with my own style. Also I created my own API and deployed with Render.
<br/>I hope you like it!

## Deploy
